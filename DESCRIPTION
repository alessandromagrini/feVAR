Description: Estimation and analysis of fixed effects vector autoregressive models. The package implements the bias-corrected ordinary least squares estimation proposed by Dhaene & Jochmans (2016 <doi:10.1016/j.econlet.2016.06.010>). In case of missing values, estimation is performed through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Several numerical and graphical tools to analyse the estimated models are available. Both panel, even unbalanced, and non-panel data are allowed.
